# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/josephbcompton08/threat-hunting-scenario-tor/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` table for any event that contained the string `"tor"`. Based on the results, between `2025-10-14T05:56:47.7330428Z` and the end of the observed activity window, an employee downloaded a Tor installer and performed actions that resulted in multiple Tor-related files being copied to the desktop. A new file named `tor-shopping-list.txt` was also created on the desktop during this period.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "josephcompton"
| where FileName contains "tor"
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2025-10-14T05:56:47.7330428Z)
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` table for any `ProcessCommandLine` that contained the string `"tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.8.exe"`. Based on the logs returned, at `2025-10-14T01:58:00Z`, the user account `josephcompton` executed a Tor Browser installer from the `Downloads` folder on the device `threat-hunt-lab`. The installer was run in silent mode, meaning it executed automatically in the background without displaying any windows or prompts. This activity is notable due to the combination of a late-night execution time, the use of a silent installation method, and the installation of Tor Browserâ€”a privacy-focused application that can sometimes be associated with attempts to conceal network activity.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.8.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceId, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName
```

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` table for any indication that the user `josephcompton` opened the Tor Browser. Based on the logs returned, at `2025-10-14T05:59:27.1748704Z`, the user launched the Tor Browser. Multiple related processes were observed following this event, including instances of `firefox.exe` (Tor) and `tor.exe`, confirming active Tor usage on the device.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"
| where FileName has_any ("tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-*.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor.exe", "tor-browser.exe", "Browser\firefox.exe", "Tor Browser\firefox.exe")
| project Timestamp, DeviceId, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName
| order by Timestamp desc

```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. At `2024-11-08T22:18:01.1246358Z`, an employee on the "threat-hunt-lab" device successfully established a connection to the remote IP address `176.198.159.33` on port `9001`. The connection was initiated by the process `tor.exe`, located in the folder `c:\users\employee\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\tor\tor.exe`. There were a couple of other connections to sites over port `443`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"  
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")  
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```
